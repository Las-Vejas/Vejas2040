## 10/5/2025 - Made the schematic and added parts onto PCB.  

I have decided to make a dev board even though I have no clue on what im doing. :sob: 
I am following the guide, and I have added all the parts on my schematic and my PCB.

Here is what my PCB looks like right now:

I have no clue where to put the capacitors but ill try my best.

Here is what my schematic looks like:

## 10/10/2025 - ReRouted the PCB  

So my routing was a mess. I rerouted and now (not fully done) im feeling (and it's looking) much better. It looks much more like an octopus branching out its tentacles. Find images below.

My next steps are going to be to add a reset button and an rbg led. I might use this as a pico alt for keyboard builds in the future.   

## 10/11/2025 - Finished the pcb and jlc  

So I finished routing the pcb. I added the neopixel (which I will have to buy and add separately, as PCBA for it would cost a fortune) and a reset button. Im planning to solder the neopixel at school as I think there may be a hotplate somewhere there. 
The whole PCB is now finished and the project is done.
